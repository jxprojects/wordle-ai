            So wordle is popular. I thought it would be interesting to try to make an AI 
            that would solve for the best possible sequence of guesses to win.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first task was to build the game. We probably all know the rules at this
            point, but to summarize, you try to guess a certain five-letter word in six or less guesses based on
            clues that the game gives you about previous guesses. If a certain letter in 
            your guess is in the same place as it is in the correct word, it will be marked
            as green. If a letter is in the word but in the wrong place, it's marked as yellow.
            If it does not show up, it is marked as black. One thing to note about this is that
            if a certain letter shows up strictly once in the correct word but is included 
            more than once in a guess, only one of the letters will actually be marked green or
            yellow. For instance, if your correct word is "metal" but you guess "gamma," your 
            guess will show as <mark id="black">g</mark><mark id="yellow">a</mark><mark id="yellow">m</mark><mark id="black">m</mark><mark id="black">a</mark>,
            not <mark id="black">g</mark><mark id="yellow">a</mark><mark id="yellow">m</mark><mark id="yellow">m</mark><mark id="yellow">a</mark>.
            Also, there are about 13000 possible guesses with about 3000 possible correct answers, each taken
            from text files.
        </p>
        <p>
            For my Java terminal version, the command line prompts you to type in a potential five-letter
            guess, and it will print the coloring with text background colors (you also have the 
            option of watching the AI play).
        </p>
        <p id="cont">
            Now for solving, the algorithm goes like this:
        </p>
        <p class="bigtab">
            * For every potential guess you can make at a given turn, consider all possible 
            sequences of colorings you can receive in return. <br>
            * For every one of those, compute the probability of receiving that coloring, 
            as well as the number of potential answers you can limit your search space to
            given that coloring (this gives your expected value for a given guess). <br>
            * Store all those expected values and pick the word corresponding to the lowest
            one as your next guess. <br>
            * Cut down your potential answer search space based 
            on the sequence of colors received on your last guess (if a given answer has
            a different letter in a place that is green, eliminate it, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            It's clear that, with several thousand possible guesses and answers to start with 
            as well as 243 cases to check, the search for the best first guess would take quite
            a while. I'd estimate 20 minutes, but I ran through this only a few times and 
            modified my program to print the first 20 best guesses so I could tell my AI to just
            pick one of these each first guess (and here's a text file with the best 100 guesses
            if you're interested: <a href="">this</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            But the good thing is that the AI (kind of) gains efficiency as it cuts down its search
            space with each next guess. For instance, the first guess 'irate' limits the number 
            of potential answers to about 70 on average, which is a lot better than a factor of 3000.
            But there's still a chance of the program being horribly inefficient when it gets one of 
            the worse cases of colorings, plus the fact that it's still checking all 13000 possible
            guesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, in an effort to save some time (this is also the current state of the program), the AI
            cuts his potential guess search space according to the coloring as well. The problem is, 
            it now sometimes does this: <br>
            <img id="aw" src="images/smh.png"> <br>
            Hey, I do that too, but guess like "flaky" could have determined the possibilities of four 
            potential letters there, so chances are that wasn't the best way to go about solving. Likewise,
            for cases of missing just one letter (ex. <mark id="black">f</mark><mark id="green">i</mark><mark id="green">g</mark><mark id="green">h</mark><mark id="green">t</mark>)
            it kind of just becomes a guessing game with the rest of the possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's definitely a lot more efficient though. A 30-40 second guess from before now takes 
            a fraction of a second, and the average number of guesses to win is about 3 or 4.
        </p>
